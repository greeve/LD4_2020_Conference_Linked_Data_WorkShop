# !!DRAFT!! A Hands-on Look at Linked Data
Here you will find support materials for a workshop offered as part of the LD4 2020 Conference, meant to introduce participants to concepts and tools for accessing and querying linked data.


## Format
Asynchronous workshop with video/slides, hands-ons exercises, and “office hours” and Slack Channel to discuss content


## Intended audience
Anyone who wishes to participate in a linked data project whether they come from a metadata background or other discipline, and wants an introduction to tools for accessing and assessing linked data.


## Description
Individuals brought into linked data projects need to understand certain fundamentals in order to navigate the mechanics of linked data and better understand the data itself. These fundamentals and related tooling provide the ability to more easily perform analysis and guide the use of existing linked data. This 3 hour workshop will introduce attendees to essential RDF and linked data concepts, provide hands-on exercises using select tools and techniques for accessing linked data, and allow for discussions on how this knowledge can be used in the work we do.


## Outcomes
* A pragmatic understanding of RDF, linked data, and http
* The ability to read/write Turtle RDF syntax
* Introduction to SPARQL queries (building on the introduction to Turtle syntax)
* Ability to access different linked data sources using a limited number of tools (SPARQL endpoints, command line cURL, possibly others)
* A network of colleagues and materials to refer back to when related questions come up in the future


## Equipment
* computer with internet
* web browser
* curl command line tool  -  *Most machines come with with curl installed. To check, open your command line window and enter `curl --help`. If you don't see a help menu after hitting enter, then go to https://curl.haxx.se/dlwiz/ to install it.*

## Ground rules
In discussion spaces, let’s please adhere to the [Recurse Center’s Social Rules](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules) (special thanks to Christina Harlow for making me aware of these)

* No feigning surprise; e.g. “Wow, you don’t know…?!?”
* No well-actually’s
* No backseat driving; if you’re going to help, fully engage
* No subtle-isms (small things that make others feel unwelcomed)


## N.B.
This workshop is a reformatting of a previously held in-person workshop: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RtDqWRCSmQgge8voYCaCkT3AV3U5IDhfHlFrEW_CMlk/edit?usp=sharing. This is the first time this content will be provided as an asychronous experience. Don't hesitate to make contact if any aspect of this format isn't working for you, sf433(at)cornell(dot)edu.


## Now let's get started!
